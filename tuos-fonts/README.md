# tuos-latex
Trivial LaTeX style for for using the cooperate fonts used by The
University Sheffield. The actual magic is done by two style files that
are auto-generated by `autoinst`, which is part of
[Fontool](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/fontools/).

## Prerequists 

* The
  [Stephenson and Blake fonts](https://www.shef.ac.uk/marketing/help-yourself/visual-identity/core-elements/fonts/blake-stephenson)
  used by The University for Sheffield. Note that you need to be a
  member of the University do
  [download](https://www.shef.ac.uk/marketing/help-yourself/visual-identity/downloads/fonts/download-stephenson-blake)
  them.

* The `autoinst' too from the
  [Fontool](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/fontools/)
  package. If you have a modern LaTeX distribution, it is most likely
  already installed on your machine. 


## Installation 
* First, we use `autoinst` to generate LaTeX styles
  for both fonts.
  * Unzip the archive with the fonts:
    ```
    mkdir fonts
    cd fonts 
    unzip ../Fonts.zip 
    ```
  * Now use `autoinst` for generating the font-specific LaTeX
    styles (using the default, autoinst will install the styles
    in your home directory):
    * Stephenson (the serif font) 
      ```
      autoinst Steph.ttf StephBd.ttf StephIt.ttf
      ```
    * Blake (the sans serif font) 
      ```
      autoinst -sanserif Blake.ttf BlakeBd.ttf BlakeIt.ttf 
      ```
      * Most likely, you need to update the font maps. Please consult
        your LaTeX distribution and operating system help for detailed
        instructions. For example, in case Debian, you might (for a
        system wide-installation) to edit
        `/etc/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg` and add the two lines (adapt the
        path information):
        ```
        MixedMap TUOSBlake/TUOSBlake.map
        MixedMap TUOSStephenson/TUOSStephenson.map
        ```
        and call `update-updmap`.
* For your convince, you might want to install `tuos-fonts.sty`, which
  just includes the generated styles for Stephenson and Blake and
  configures them using lining figures (as this is the default used by
  The University of Sheffield.

Please not that the fonts provided by The University of Sheffield do
not provide all the symbols requires for type-setting mathematical
